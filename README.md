# midnight-snack

The premise of this game is that the player up late and hungry and 
wants a midnight night, but they don't have any groceries. They must
make it through the hallway, down the stairs, and into the kitchen 
without disturbing their roommates. 

At each stage, the player has a few choices for how to proceed. Once
they pick one, they will roll and depending on the number, they are 
will move on to the next step, lose some health or stealth points, or 
die in a freak accident. 

Possible outcomes include tripping over the roommates' cat Josephine,
falling down the stairs, setting the house on fire, or choking to death
on a spoonfull of cereal.


Future Improvements:

1. There is a map on the bottom of the screen that shows where the 
player's current location is. At this point, the reset function does 
not restore the player marker back to its original position, and that
function needs to be fixed.

2. The game is not optimized for mobile.

3. Would like to add a dice roll animation.
