# midnight-snack

The goal of this game is to get yourself a midnight snack. 
The player will click through screens to pass obstacles like 
sneaking past the kids' rooms, going down the stairs, and 
actually getting the snack in the kitchen. The player will 
need to roll a die to see if they are successful at passing 
the obstacle. If their score is too low, they may wake up 
the kids, fall down the stairs, or set the house on fire. 
To win the game, the player must successfully get their 
midnight snack.
